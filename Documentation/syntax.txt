This will not be captured by the reader. 
Text here will be unaccounted for because 
there is no date header to give this 
context. 

# 2014-03-31

The format is Year-Month-Day after a single '#' as if it
were the markdown equivalent of an "h1." tag. 

The words here will be associated with the above date,
2014-03-31.

For this version, the only significant or reserved
words are:

1. "^---" followed by "^---" on another line
2. "^# dddd-dd-dd" and text associated with that day

# 2014-04-01

This is a new day. The yamlreader will parse this to be
active for a second day, now.
